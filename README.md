# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of the repositry was to make changes to the PlanMyTrip app so that travelers can input their weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route was created between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
